# WouldYouRather
"Would You Rather?" Project, It is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

1. npm version 13.13.0
1. yarn 1.22.17

## Step-by-step install guide
1. Install project specific dependencies with `yarn`
1. Run the would-you-rather with `yarn start`
1. Test would-you-rather is yielding data and not an error with `open http://local.nbc.com:3000/`
